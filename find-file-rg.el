;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package allows to find files in `project-current' or any directory using 'rg --files' command.
;;
;; As the ripgrep user, I have fine-tuned `.ignore` file in my projects folders to exclude
;; certain files from grepping.  It turned out that `rg --files` provides the list of only interesting files.
;;
;; - `find-file-rg'
;;
;;   Asks for project dir if needed and reads filename with completing function.
;;   `project-current' is used as the default directory to search in.
;;   If invoked with prefix argument, always asks for directory to find files in.
;;
;; - `find-file-rg-at-point'
;;
;;   Calls `find-file-rg' with active region or filename at point as initial value
;;   for completing function.
